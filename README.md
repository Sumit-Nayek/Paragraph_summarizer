# 📄 Paragraph Summarizer

## Project Overview
**Paragraph Summarizer** is a simple AI-powered tool for summarizing paragraphs or longer texts into concise, coherent summaries. The app uses natural language processing (NLP) and transformer models to identify salient points and generate readable summaries.

---

## Objective  
The objective is to help users:
- **Quickly compress** long paragraphs or articles into short summaries.  
- Improve reading efficiency by extracting key ideas.  
- Use AI summarization in writing, research, content creation, or learning tasks.

## Tools & Techniques Used
- **Python** – Core programming language.  
- **Transformers / Hugging Face** – Pretrained sequence-to-sequence models for summarization (e.g. BART, T5).  
- **NLTK / spaCy** – For tokenization, cleanup, and preprocessing (optional).  
- **Streamlit or Flask** – For building an interactive front-end to allow user inputs and display results.  
- **Prompt Engineering** – Tuning model inputs and output formatting for crisp summaries.
